    <h2>A Legacy of Superior Bat Making</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The company was founded in 1908 and was one of the primary bat suppliers to the 1908 World Series Champion Cubs </p></li>
<li><p>After the Cubs historic 1908 campaign and their superior offense, word spread about Kellogg Baseball Bats</p></li>
<li><p>The Pittsburgh Pirates became a huge buyer of these bats which have been outfitting every World Series Championship team since the 1908 Cubs</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Today, the company is helmed by one of baseball's finest minds, Dean Cornelli</h2>
